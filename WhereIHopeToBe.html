I hope to pursue a career in law.  To go to college and accomplish many things during the period of my life. 
Who knows maybe one day I’ll run for congress a long a friend that I hope will become someone of much power and knowledge. His name will remain unknown because one day you will see him and you’ll know who I am talking about. 
I don’t know where life will take me but I really do hope that the path I chose is the right one for me.
