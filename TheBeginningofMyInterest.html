It's funny because I always have had an interest in advocating for people’s rights but what I didn't know is that I could have a voice of my own. It's funny how I even came across this because I was just sitting scrolling on my YouTube and I saw a video of one of Ben Shapiro debates. I watched it I was immediately blown away by the amount of knowledge and respectful debate that was going on. After that single video I could just not help from educating myself about the most controversial issues to everyday issues.  I’m just 16 years old and already began a serious interest in law. 
And I hope to continue this journey.
