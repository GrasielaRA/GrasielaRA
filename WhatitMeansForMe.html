Well you might wonder what a 16 year old girl knows about politics. I know a lot I mean I’m not the smartest individual ever but trust me I can make a good case.  It’s the facts against emotions. Nothing can be proven with emotion – I think that’s the beauty of debate. Only facts are presented to argue once side. I continue to learn every day from the simplest things to the most complex issue. And even it’s hard at times to take the right side I think when educated and seeing different perspectives with the understanding of respect then the right side can be any.
