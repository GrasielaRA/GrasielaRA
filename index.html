    <p> Hi, I' am Grasiela and welcome to my webpage. I'm a junior in DSST College View High School taking a class of Computer Science.  <a class="brand" href="https://www.dsstpublicschools.org/college-view-high-school">DSST College View High School</a>.</p>
    <p> I was born in Denver,CO with Mexican roots. I'm still unclear about what the future holds for me but I do hope to pursue a career as a lawyer. As much as plans for the future I have many but wish to keep in secrecy for the sake of surpirce.
    The phot shows State Represantative Kerry Tipper(in the middle) that I had the incredible pleasure of meeting plus that shes a very caring person especially for teenagers here in Colorado. I got the privilige to see how lawmakers like her work and communicate their ideas. It was a great experice to spend a day in the State Capitol. I alos meet a new friend, Meghan(to the left), which I'm sure by the things that she told me she hopes to accomplish she will be a leading example in todays youth. I can't wait to see what she does in the future.  </p>
